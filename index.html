  <h3 class="font-medium mb-2">A Note Before We Begin</h3>
  
  <p class="mb-2">This lesson explores family connections and cultural heritage. While family can be a source of inspiration, it can also carry pain. Please feel welcome to adapt any activities in ways that honour your own experience.</p>

  <p class="mb-2">Throughout this lesson, you'll also encounter references to ancient Greece. These aren’t meant to elevate one tradition over others, but to offer a familiar starting point for discussing intergenerational knowledge. The ideas we explore are grounded in many traditions, from Indigenous storytelling circles to family kitchens and memory gardens around the world.</p>

  <p class="mb-2">This project was also partly inspired by <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/14675986.2016.1240496" class="text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-800 underline" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Marcella LaFever’s work</a> on incorporating the Medicine Wheel into post-secondary course design. Her writing invites educators to consider learning as a whole-person process, a process that includes not only cognitive and physical skills, but also emotional and spiritual growth.</p>

  <p>While this lesson draws from those ideas, it does not attempt to represent or replicate Indigenous frameworks. The Medicine Wheel has deep cultural and spiritual significance for many Indigenous communities. This reference is offered with respect and humility. If you're interested in learning more, I encourage you to read LaFever’s article or seek out Indigenous educators in your community.</p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">The Challenge: Preserving Cultural Knowledge</h2>
            <div class="info-box info-box-green">
                <p class="mb-4">Communities around the world are facing a critical challenge: valuable cultural knowledge, traditions, and stories are being lost as generations become more disconnected. When elders pass away without sharing their wisdom, we lose irreplaceable parts of our heritage.</p>
                <p class="font-medium">How might we create physical spaces that bridge generational gaps and preserve cultural knowledge in a way that engages both youth and elders?</p>

        <img src="images/ajax.jpg" alt="Classical engraving of Ajax, a hero from Greek mythology" class="rounded-lg shadow-sm w-full" />
        <p class="text-xs text-gray-600 mt-1 italic">Statue of Ajax, one of the heroes whose deeds were preserved through oral tradition before being recorded in Homer's Iliad.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="md:w-1/2">
        <p class="mb-4">Imagine yourself by a campfire 3,000 years ago, listening to the Iliad. The poet tells of Nestor, an elder warrior who recalls heroes from even earlier times. Though no longer fighting himself, Nestor guides younger warriors through his stories, preserving wisdom from past generations.</p>
        
<p class="mb-4">In this lesson, you'll design a "memory garden." A memory garden is an intentional space that preserves cultural knowledge by triggering stories and connecting generations. These gardens aren't just for walking through; they're spaces where people connect to their past and develop a deeper sense of belonging to their families and communities.</p>

    <h3 class="font-medium mb-2">A Holistic Approach to Learning</h3>
    <p>Memory gardens engage us as whole beings: intellectually through the knowledge they preserve, physically through sensory experiences, emotionally through the stories they evoke, and spiritually through the connections they foster. This approach to learning, which honors all dimensions of human experience, resonates with both classical wisdom traditions and Indigenous frameworks like the Medicine Wheel.</p>
</div>

 <div class="reflection-prompt mb-6">
    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-3">Reflection Moment</h3>
    <p class="mb-3">Think of a place that holds a strong memory. It could be a kitchen, a tree, a park, anywhere!</p>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-3">
        <li>What sounds, smells, textures, or sights do you remember?</li>
        <li>What lessons or stories came from that space?</li>
        <li>How could you share that place's meaning with future generations?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Keep these reflections in mind as we explore the concept of memory gardens together.</p>
</div>           
    
        <h4 class="font-medium mb-2">What Makes Memory Gardens Effective?</h4>
        <p class="mb-4">Memory gardens bridge the limitations of other knowledge preservation methods. Unlike oral traditions that may be forgotten or artifacts that lose context, memory gardens create environments where:</p>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 text-gray-700">
            <li><strong>Sensory triggers</strong> (scents, textures, visual elements) naturally evoke memories and stories</li>
            <li><strong>Shared spaces</strong> facilitate conversation between generations</li>
            <li><strong>Living elements</strong> symbolize the ongoing nature of cultural knowledge</li>
            <li><strong>Physical manifestations</strong> of values and traditions make abstract concepts tangible</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <p class="mb-4">As you prepare to design your own memory garden, consider what sensory elements might best trigger important stories or values you wish to preserve.</p>
        <div class="reflection-prompt mb-6">
 <p class="italic">"Mightiest were these of men reared upon the earth; mightiest were they, and with the mightiest they fought, the mountain-dwelling centaurs, and they destroyed them terribly. With these men I had fellowship, when I came from Pylos, from a distant land far away; for they themselves called me. And I fought on my own; with those men could no one fight of the mortals now upon the earth."</p><br>— Nestor, in Homer's Iliad</p>
             <p class="my-4">Like Nestor sharing tales of heroes past, this lesson will guide you in creating spaces where stories, values, and traditions can be preserved across generations.</p>
